# Analyzing Diabetes Dataset

This repository contains the final project for the **DSAI 307: Statistical Inference** course, which involves a thorough analysis of the publicly available [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibur013/diabetes-dataset). The goal is to apply statistical and visualization techniques to uncover insights and trends related to diabetes.

## Project Overview

The project is structured into five parts:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and analyze key trends such as glucose levels, BMI, and other health metrics for diabetic and non-diabetic groups.
2. **Answering Questions:** Explore relationships between variables, such as the impact of glucose levels, age, and pregnancies on diabetes risk.
3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Conduct hypothesis tests to validate claims, such as differences in glucose levels between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
4. **Simulation Tasks:** Apply confidence interval analysis to understand the effect of sample size on estimation accuracy.
5. **Documentation:** Provide insights through a detailed notebook and a high-level PDF report.

## Key Tasks

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze trends like average glucose levels, BMI, and diabetes occurrence.
- Explore distributions of variables like BMI and Diabetes Pedigree Function.

### Hypothesis Testing
- Test claims like differences in glucose levels between groups.
- Validate findings with statistical significance (Î± = 0.05).

### Confidence Interval Analysis
- Generate random samples of different sizes and analyze the behavior of confidence intervals.
- Compare findings across sample sizes (e.g., 15, 100, 10).

### Visualization
- Create impactful visualizations to communicate insights using principles from the book *Storytelling with Data*.

## Dataset Description

The [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibur013/diabetes-dataset) contains health metrics like glucose levels, BMI, age, and blood pressure for patients. Key considerations:
- Understand column meanings and value ranges.
- Address missing values and outliers.
- Account for demographic-specific biases.

## Technical Implementation

The implementation is documented in a Jupyter Notebook:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Includes steps for handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering.
- **EDA:** Statistical analysis and visualizations for trends and relationships.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Statistical tests with clear interpretations.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Sampling and interval calculations.

## Results

Key findings include:
- Higher glucose levels are strongly associated with diabetes.
- Older patients show increased glucose and insulin levels.
- Common risk profiles for diabetic patients involve high BMI, glucose levels, and age.

Visualizations and detailed commentary are included in the notebook.
